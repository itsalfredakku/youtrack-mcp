# YouTrack MCP Server - Missing API Implementation Report

## Executive Summary

Based on analysis of the YouTrack OpenAPI specification (version 2025.2), several high-value API features are currently not implemented in the MCP server. This document outlines the missing features and their implementation priority.

## Technical Notes

### Project Scoping Enforcement
All new API clients inherit project scoping from BaseAPIClient. When PROJECT_ID is configured:
- Activities: Already scoped via issue queries
- Commands: Works on specified issues only
- Search Assist: Can be scoped to project context
- Saved Queries: User-specific, but used with scoped searches
- Issue Count: Uses same query scoping as search

### Authentication
All new APIs use the same OAuth2 authentication flow via AuthenticationManager.

### Caching
New API clients support caching via CacheManager:
- Activities: Cached for 5 minutes
- Commands: Not cached (write operations)
- Search Assist: Cached for 10 minutes
- Saved Queries: Cached for 5 minutes
- Issue Count: Cached for 1 minute

### Error Handling
All new APIs use ErrorHandler for consistent error formatting and logging.

## Benefits of New Features

### Activities API
- **Change Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all issue modifications
- **Team Collaboration**: See who changed what and when
- **Analytics**: Track issue lifecycle and bottlenecks
- **Compliance**: Required for regulatory audits

### Commands API
- **Bulk Operations**: Update hundreds of issues with one command
- **Automation**: Integrate with CI/CD for automatic status updates
- **Workflow Efficiency**: Save time on repetitive tasks
- **Consistency**: Ensure uniform field updates

### Search Assist API
- **User Experience**: Better search with auto-completion
- **Discoverability**: Users find fields and values easily
- **Accuracy**: Reduce search syntax errors
- **Speed**: Faster query building

### Issue Count API
- **Performance**: Get counts without fetching all data
- **Dashboards**: Build real-time metrics displays
- **Analytics**: Quick statistics and reporting
- **Resource Efficiency**: Reduce API payload size

### Saved Queries API
- **Organization**: Manage frequently used searches
- **Collaboration**: Share searches across team
- **Efficiency**: Quick access to common queries
- **Customization**: Build personalized workspace

## Next Steps

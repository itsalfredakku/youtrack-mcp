## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **ðŸš€ CRITICAL PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT: Optimized Field Configurations**
  - Implemented separate field sets for list vs. detail operations
  - **List operations**: Return only essential fields (id, summary, status, dates) - **60-80% smaller payloads**
  - **Detail operations**: Return complete data with full content, comments, attachments
  - **Search operations**: Return balanced field set with preview data
  - New `field-configurations.ts` module with optimized field sets for all entities
  - Applied to: Issues, Articles, Projects, Users, Work Items, Agile Boards, Sprints, Activities
  - **Performance gains**: List responses are now 3-10x faster and use significantly less bandwidth
  - **Better UX**: Lists are scannable without overwhelming detail, full data available on-demand

- **Activities API** - Complete issue activity tracking and audit trail
  - `activities` MCP tool with 6 actions (get_global, get_activity, get_page, get_issue, get_issue_activity, get_issue_page)
  - Filter by categories, author, issue query, reverse chronological order
  - Cursor-based pagination for large activity sets
  - API endpoints: `/api/activities`, `/api/activitiesPage`, `/api/issues/{id}/activities`

- **Commands API** - Bulk operations on multiple issues
  - `commands` MCP tool with 2 actions (apply, suggest)
  - Apply commands to multiple issues simultaneously
  - Silent execution mode (mute notifications)
  - Run commands as different users
  - Command auto-completion and suggestions
  - API endpoint: `POST /api/commands`

- **Search Assist API** - Query auto-completion and suggestions
  - `search_assist` MCP tool for context-aware search suggestions
  - Auto-complete field names and values
  - Project-scoped suggestions
  - Caret position support for mid-query completion
  - API endpoint: `POST /api/search/assist`

- **Saved Queries API** - Saved search management

### Fixed
- **Critical Project Scoping Bug** - Issue search now properly respects PROJECT_ID configuration
  - Fixed 'query' action to use `handleQueryIssues` for consistent project scoping
  - Fixed 'search' action to use `resolveProjectId` for proper project filtering
  - Prevents cross-project data leakage when PROJECT_ID is configured
